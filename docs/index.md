## Welcome to DAT158ML
This is the website of the machine learning part of the course _DAT158: Machine learning engineering and advanced algorithms_ at the [Western Norway University of Applied Sciences](https://www.hvl.no/en/studies-at-hvl/study-programmes/course/dat158), containing code and documentation for the programming parts of the course.

Go to [Canvas](https://hvl.instructure.com/courses/14467) for additional course information.

## Getting started

### Set up your computer

Go to [Set up your computer](setup.md) for step by step instructions

### Course notebooks
The course is based on Jupyter Notebook, a web-based framework to write and present code-based projects. Have a look at https://youtu.be/HW29067qVWk and https://youtu.be/2eCHD6f_phE for short introductions to Jupyter Notebooks.

Throughout the course you will work with notebooks containing various material and coding exercises. _It is recommended to make copies of the course notebooks before editing_. You can follow the naming convention `my_[name_of_original_notebook].ipynb`.

To browse through the course notebooks non-interactively, use jupyter.org's nbviewer by clicking [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/alu042/DAT158ML/blob/master/docs/notebooks.ipynb).
